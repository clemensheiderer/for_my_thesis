Command: iqtree2 -s PF3560_subtree1_Node4*_Node5*.fasta -t PF3560.fasta_0.05.satute.node_subtree1_Node4*_Node5*.nwk -bb 10000 -wbt -m JC
Seed:    629877 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Feb  7 17:45:54 2024
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
