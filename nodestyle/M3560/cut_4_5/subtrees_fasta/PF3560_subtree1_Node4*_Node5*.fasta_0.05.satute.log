Running IQ-TREE with constructed arguments
Please consider for the analysis that IQ-Tree will be running with default options.
If specific options are required for the analysis, please run IQ-Tree separately.
Used IQ-TREE options:
-s /home/clemens/Downloads/M3560/M3560_2/cut_4_5/subtrees_fasta/PF3560_subtree1_Node4*_Node5*.fasta
--ufboot 10000 -m JC --quiet --keep-ident

            Running tests and initial IQ-Tree with configurations:
            Mode msa + model
            Model: JC
            Alpha: 0.05
            Running Saturation Test on file: /home/clemens/Downloads/M3560/M3560_2/cut_4_5/subtrees_fasta/PF3560_subtree1_Node4*_Node5*.fasta
            Number of rate categories: 1
            Considered rate category: all
            Options for Initial IQ-Tree run: msa + model
            Multiplicity: 3
            Run test for saturation for each branch and category with 1 rate categories
            Results will be written to the directory:subtrees_fasta
